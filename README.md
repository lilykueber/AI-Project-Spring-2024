This code was made for an Artificial Intelligence class

The goal was to focus on a topic in the world of AI and make a very basic demo. The topic chosen was video game design with the use of ai 
with apresentation (not included).

I based my game off of the popular video game "The Akinator" made by developer Elokence, released in 2007.
The game is similar to 20 questions. The original game includes a genie that "reads your mind" based on a category
chosen by the user at the beginning. The game uses information theory to select and ask the fewest amount of questions
to distrubute them into categories. It then uses classification algorithms, pattern reognition, and training data to 
find similarities.

The code provided was the final submission of python code. The user is prompted to choose a category and then the code is able to guess
the option the user is thinking of.
